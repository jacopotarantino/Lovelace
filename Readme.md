## Description

Lovelace provides a framework for developing UI components in a way that is both sane and highly scalable. It focuses on developer happiness by providing a neat organizational scructure with all files relevant to a single component in a single folder. Components are written in terse, compiled languages so that we can code as little as possible. Lovelace is also designed to be consumed by large infrastructures that may involve many different languages and frameworks and complicated deployment processes.

#TODO description of how each component is structured, how the build process works and how each abstraction layer plays nicely with the others.
